[{"q":"<p>In Data Structures, you are given the following two arrays <strong>arr1[]</strong> and <strong>arr2[]</strong>. If you are required to check both of the arrays are permutations to each other then which of the following techniques can be implemented in this scenario:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arrays</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\"><code>arr1[] = {1, 3, 5, 2, 2, 5, 6, 4}\narr2[] = {4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 6, 5}</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Techniques</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Sort both the arrays and compare both the arrays. If both the arrays are identical, then return true. Otherwise return false</li>\n\t<li>Create a Hash Map for all the elements of <strong>arr1[]</strong> such that all the elements from the array are keys and their corresponding frequencies in the array are values. Now, traverse <strong>arr2[]</strong> and search for each element of <strong>arr2[]</strong> in the hash map. If an element is found then decrement its count in the hash map. Otherwise, return false. If all elements are found and the value of every key in the hash map is equal to zero, then return true. Otherwise, return false.</li>\n\t<li>Create a circular linked list such that all the elements from both <strong>arr1[]</strong> and <strong>arr2[]</strong> are inserted into this linked list. Now, apply DFS technique on <strong>arr2[]</strong>. If elements found, then return true. Otherwise, return false.</li>\n</ol>","a":[{"id":1347178,"option":"1 and 2","correct":true},{"id":1347179,"option":"2 and 3","correct":false},{"id":1347180,"option":"1 and 3","correct":false},{"id":1347181,"option":"All of these","correct":false}]}]
