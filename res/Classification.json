[{"q":"<p>In Machine Learning, you are given the following scenario:</p>\n\n<p>A fuel plant wants to improve the yield of its factories present in various locations. In one such factory, ABC gas is converted into XYZ pellets. There are 30 controllable variables such as pressure, flow rates, temperature, etc.. The yield is high on some days and low on other days. The company wants to control the variables to produce a high yield on all days.</p>\n\n<p>Which of the following algorithms can be applied in this scenario?</p>","a":[{"id":1356169,"option":"Linear regression","correct":false},{"id":1356170,"option":"Classification","correct":true},{"id":1356171,"option":"Random forest","correct":false},{"id":1356172,"option":"Naive bayes","correct":false}]}]
