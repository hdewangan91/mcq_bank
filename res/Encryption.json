[{"q":"<p>Alice is working as a cloud administrator in an organization. She wants to encrypt her data while sending it to her clients to make sure that the data is secured and uninterrupted. She had implemented the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm earlier but she wanted an algorithm that is faster and better than DES. She wants to implement the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm (AES)&nbsp;for this purpose. Now, which of the following sequences of steps does she needs to implement in this scenario:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Add the initial round key to the starting state array.</li>\n\t<li>Perform the tenth and final round of state manipulation.</li>\n\t<li>Derive the set of round keys from the cipher key.</li>\n\t<li>Initialize the state array with the block data (plaintext).</li>\n\t<li>Perform nine rounds of state manipulation.</li>\n\t<li>Copy the final state array out as the encrypted data (ciphertext).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>The block to be encrypted is just a sequence of 128 bits.&nbsp;</p>","a":[{"id":1708459,"option":"1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6","correct":false},{"id":1708460,"option":"1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6","correct":false},{"id":1708461,"option":"3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6","correct":true},{"id":1708462,"option":"3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6","correct":false}]}]
